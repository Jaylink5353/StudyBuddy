# A little Pomodoro Timer that sits on your desk! 
More info to come soon, I'm currently working on concept designs.

### Project Goals:
- [ ] Make a physical piece of hardware with a buzzer, screen, buttons, etc and fully program it so it works independently. (Pomodoro, of course)
- [ ] Create a mobile app to set the timer, manage focus settings (iOS), and send alerts when break time is done.
- [ ] Make it cute!


### Roadmap:
- [ ] Concept the design of the project
- [ ] Design and test arduino code and circut for the timer.
- [ ] Create Schematic and Design PCB
- [ ] Design a case for the timer.
- [ ] Code the timer's BLE and mobile apps for it.
- [ ] Shipped!


### Bill of Materials:
TBD!
